# Problem 1

## Function to randomly draw birthday, check duplicates and return true or false

``` r
sim_birthday = function(n) {

  birthdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  duplicate = length(unique(birthdays)) < n
  
  return(duplicate)
  
}
```

## Run function 10000 times for each group size between 2 and 50

``` r
sim_birthday_results = 
  expand_grid(n = 2:50,
              iter = 1:10000) |> 
  mutate(birthday_result = map_lgl(n, sim_birthday)) |> 
  group_by(n) |> 
  summarize(probability = mean(birthday_result))
```

## Plot the probability as a function of group size

``` r
sim_birthday_results |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = probability)) + 
  geom_line()
```

Group size and the probability that at least two people in group will
share a birthday shows a positive relationship. As the group size
increases, the probability also increases, approaching the value of 1.
